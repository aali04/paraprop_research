Column 2: Refractive Index values as determined using the density corresponding to the depth values with the relation "n= 1 +.845*rho"


Description:

"The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) is the sole interior Greenlandic ice stream. Fast flow initiates near the summit dome, and the ice stream terminates approximately 1000 km downstream in three large outlet glaciers that calve into the Greenland Sea. To better understand this important system, in the summer of 2012 we drilled a 67 m firn core and conducted ground-based radio-echo sounding (RES) and active-source seismic surveys at a site approximately 150 km downstream from the onset of streaming flow (NEGIS firn core, 75 37.61'N, 35 56.49'W). The site is representative of the upper part of the ice stream, while also being in a crevasse-free area for safe surface operations."(Taken from Abstract)
